# Machine Learning ðŸ§ 
In this directory I created an artificial intelligence that I learned in the "Minicourse: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence in Python", from UFU - Federal University of UberlÃ¢ndia. Available in: https://youtu.be/6ly1KKobfOA. This neural network defines whether something is a human or a horse.

# Libraries used ðŸ“š

- TensorFlow: TensorFlow is a complete open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive and flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that enable researchers to advance next-generation ML and developers to build and deploy ML-powered applications.

- NumPy: NumPy is the foundational package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as arrays and masked arrays), and a variety of routines for quick operations on arrays, including math, logic, shape manipulation, sorting, selection, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.

- MatPlotLib: Matplotlib is a software library for creating graphs and general data visualizations, made for and from the Python programming language and its NumPy math extension.

- Keras: Keras is an API designed for humans, not machines. Keras follows best practices to reduce cognitive load: it offers consistent and simple APIs, minimizes the number of user actions required for common use cases, and provides clear, actionable error messages. It also has extensive documentation and developer guides.
